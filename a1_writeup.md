# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

My initial thoughts about the python language is that is is a medium difficulty programming language and is not easily understood but not hard.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Python similar to HTML is a bit simple but not complex, although can be difficlut to learn depending if you had any prior experience or not.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

Some things that I learned form thsi assignment are that not all example code given is perfect and sometimes you will need to seek help from other people or from other resources.You also need to constantly troubleshoot your program to make sure it works correctly and not to the point where you have so much code, you make a mistake and cannot find it.There is also no one way to code in an answer to a problem, there are many ways to do so.
